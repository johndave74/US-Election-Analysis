# US 2020 Election Analysis

This project dives into the voter distribution and patterns in the 2020 US election, exploring critical data points and visualizing trends across states. By using Pythonâ€™s data analysis and visualization libraries, we highlight significant factors such as voter turnout, state-by-state voting numbers, and geographic voting patterns, contributing to a data-driven understanding of the election dynamics.

### Project Summary

- **Objective**: Provide insights into voter turnout and distribution across the United States during the 2020 election.
- **Tools**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- **Key Visuals**: Choropleth map showing voter distribution, bar plots, and statistical summaries for comparative analysis.

### Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**:
   - Loaded and cleaned datasets on voter numbers, state codes, and electoral votes.
   - Prepared data for visualization, ensuring accurate mappings between states and their voting statistics.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Created a choropleth map displaying the number of voters per state to visualize geographical trends.
   - Generated summary statistics and comparative bar charts to examine voter distribution among different states.

3. **Visualization Highlights**:
   - **Choropleth Map**: Visualizes the number of voters per state using color gradients to emphasize high and low voter counts.
   - **Bar Plots**: Compares voter turnout across states, allowing for quick insights into states with the highest and lowest participation.

### Notable Insights

- **Top Voting States**: States like Florida and California demonstrated the highest voter counts.
- **Electoral Vote Correlation**: Visualizations explore how voter numbers compare with the electoral vote distribution.
- **Geographic Trends**: The map highlights interesting regional patterns in voter participation, showing concentrated voting activity in certain states.

### Usage

To run this analysis:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore the data and visuals interactively.

### Conclusion

This analysis provides a foundational look at US voter behavior in the 2020 election, leveraging data visualization to highlight critical patterns. It serves as a starting point for further analysis on electoral trends and demographic influence.
